// Static Assets
// Use `path.join` to combine string arguments into directory paths
// For example:
// path.join('/', 'users', 'hindreen'); // => '/users/hindreen'

// `__dirname` is a global variable available anywhere in any application
// that is run by Node that returns the full directory path beginning from

// objects that are given to all of our routes. it adds a property to the
