// Variables

// variables are names that point to a value

// defining variables

// 1) var
var a // declares a variable called a

// we use the equal sign to assign a value to a variable
a = 50;

// 2) let

let b = 100;

// 3) const

const c = 150;

// deeper dive into let and const

// variables declared with let can be re-assigned

// variables delcared with const must be assigned at declartion and can not be re-assigned

let a = 50; 
a = 100;
// this works

const b = 100;
b = 500; // this doesnt work ( throws error )
